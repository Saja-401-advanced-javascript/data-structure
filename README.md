## PseudoQueue

## Challenge Summary
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. methods : enqueue , dequeue

## Challenge Description
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class.

 PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods: enqueue which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach. dequeue which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

 ## Approach & Efficiency
* enqueue : adding an element to a queue using one array's method (big O(1))
* dequeue : removing an element from a queue using two array's methods.(big O(n))
